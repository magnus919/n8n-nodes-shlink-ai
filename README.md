# Shlink AI Agent for n8n

An AI-powered n8n community node that provides comprehensive Shlink URL shortener integration with structured responses optimized for AI-to-AI communication.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **VIBE CODED DISCLAIMER**: This project was developed using [vibe coding](https://magnus919.com/2025/06/the-vibe-coding-paradox-when-understanding-became-optional/) - building software based on intuition and pattern matching rather than deep technical understanding. While functional, proceed with appropriate caution, testing, and code review for production use.

## üéØ Problem Solved

Managing URL shortening operations in automated workflows requires:
- **Consistent API interactions** with Shlink instances
- **Structured data formats** that AI agents can easily consume
- **Comprehensive error handling** for reliable automation
- **Rich metadata** for workflow decision-making

This node provides a specialized AI agent that handles all common Shlink operations with responses designed for seamless integration into AI-driven workflow automation.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Operations
- **Create Short URLs** - Generate shortened links with custom codes, domains, and tags

- **List URLs** - Browse and filter short URLs with pagination support
- **Visit Analytics** - Access detailed click statistics and geographic data
- **Edit URLs** - Update properties of existing short URLs
- **Delete URLs** - Remove short URLs from your Shlink instance

### AI-Optimized Design
- **Structured Responses** - Consistent JSON format with success indicators, metadata, and actionable fields
- **Human-Readable Summaries** - Plain English descriptions of operations for logging and debugging

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- n8n instance (self-hosted or n8n Cloud)
- Shlink server with API access
- Node.js 18.17.0 or higher

### Install from npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-shlink-ai
```

### Install in n8n Cloud
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Community Nodes**
2. Click **Install a community node**
3. Enter: `n8n-nodes-shlink-ai`
4. Click **Install**

### Manual Installation (Self-Hosted)
```bash
# Navigate to your n8n installation
cd ~/.n8n

# Install the package
npm install n8n-nodes-shlink-ai

# Restart n8n
n8n start
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. Set Up Shlink API Credentials

First, generate an API key on your Shlink server:

```bash
# SSH into your Shlink server
shlink api-key:generate --name="n8n-integration"
```

Save the generated API key - you'll need it for n8n configuration.

### 2. Configure Credentials in n8n

1. In n8n, go to **Credentials** ‚Üí **Add Credential**
2. Search for "Shlink API" and select it
3. Fill in:
   - **Base URL**: Your Shlink instance URL (e.g., `https://your-shlink.example.com`)
   - **API Key**: The API key generated in step 1
4. Click **Test** to verify the connection
5. Click **Save**

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Example: Create a Short URL

1. Add the **Shlink AI Agent** node to your workflow
2. Select **Create Short URL** operation
3. Configure parameters:
   - **Long URL**: `https://example.com/very/long/marketing/campaign/url`
   - **Custom Short Code**: `campaign2024` (optional)
   - **Tags**: `marketing, social, 2024` (optional)
   - **Title**: `Marketing Campaign 2024` (optional)

The node returns a structured response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "operation": "create_short_url",
  "data": {
    "shortCode": "campaign2024",
    "shortUrl": "https://your-shlink.example.com/campaign2024",
    "longUrl": "https://example.com/very/long/marketing/campaign/url",
    "dateCreated": "2024-06-13T10:30:00+00:00",
    "tags": ["marketing", "social", "2024"],
    "title": "Marketing Campaign 2024"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "human_summary": "Created short URL campaign2024 for https://example.com/very/long/marketing/campaign/url",
    "actionable_fields": {
      "short_url": "https://your-shlink.example.com/campaign2024",
      "short_code": "campaign2024",
      "long_url": "https://example.com/very/long/marketing/campaign/url"
    },
    "next_possible_actions": ["get_url_details", "get_visits", "edit_url", "delete_url"]
  },
  "context": {
    "timestamp": "2024-06-13T10:30:00.000Z",
    "api_call_count": 1
  }
}
```

### Advanced Example: Analytics Dashboard

Create a workflow that:
1. **Lists all URLs** tagged with "marketing"
2. **Gets visit statistics** for each URL
3. **Sends a report** via email/Slack

```javascript
// Use the structured response in subsequent nodes
const shortUrls = $json.data.data; // Array of short URLs
const totalUrls = $json.metadata.actionable_fields.total_items;
const summary = $json.metadata.human_summary; // "Found 15 short URLs (page 1)"
```

## ü§ñ AI Integration

This node is specifically designed for AI workflow automation:

### Router Agent Pattern
Use with a router AI agent that delegates Shlink operations:

```javascript
// Router agent can easily parse responses
if (response.success) {
  const shortUrl = response.metadata.actionable_fields.short_url;
  const nextActions = response.metadata.next_possible_actions;
  // Decide what to do next based on available actions
}
```

### Error Handling
Structured error responses help AI agents handle failures gracefully:

```javascript
if (!response.success) {
  const errorSummary = response.metadata.human_summary;
  const recoveryActions = response.metadata.next_possible_actions;
  // AI can decide how to recover based on suggested actions
}
```

## üß™ Testing
